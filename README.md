Computational modeling enables us to simulate and observe emergent cognitive phenomena in humans and machines. It helps us turn intangible theories of psychophysical and information processes into something tangible, allowing us to study human behaviors in ways that are mathematically representable and abstractable. In so doing, it enriches the understanding of our interaction with our surrounding environments and with each other. 

Here at DreamDrone, we are interested in simulating machines that are flown by humans: in both real world and virtual; flown in solo and together; with sights and with sounds. Come fly with us. Let's fly, let's fly away!
